# Case-Study-
This Case Study involves analyzing transaction data from the financial application PhonePe along with the demographic data across various states and districts in india. 
# Objective - 
The objective is to provide insights  into transaction trends, device usage and demographic correlations while ensuring data consistency.

# Questions -

# 1 Data loading and understanding :
1.1 load each dataset and display its structure       
1.2 display basic statistics and data type for each dataset  
1.3 handle missing value if any 

# 2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2.1 Analyze transaction trend over the years for each state  
2.2 identify the most common transaction type for each state and quarter  
2.3 determine the device brand with the highest number of registered users in each state  
2.4 create a list of top district per state based on population   
2.5 calculate the average transaction value for each state  
2.6 analyze app usage trends   
2.7 distribution of transaction types  
2.8 find unique mapping between district name and district code   

# 3 Data Quality Checks
Ensure data consistency across state and district level   
-- for each state, calculate the total number of transactions, total transaction amount and total registered users by summing up the value from district level data     
-- compare the result with the corresponding value at state level to ensure they match   
-- display any discrepancies found between the district level and state level data   

# 4 Data Merging and advance analysis
4.1 ratio of users by population by state   
4.2 correlate population density with transaction volume   
4.3 Average transaction amount per user  
4.4 device brand usage ratio  

# 5 Data visualization 
5.1 plot the total transactions and amount over time for a selected state   
5.2 create a pie chart showing the distribution of transaction type for a specific quarter  
5.3 visualize the population density of districts in a selected state   

# 6 insights and conclusion 
6.1 identify any trend or pattern in transaction data   
6.2 correlate demographic data with transaction data  
6.3 summarize finding and insights
